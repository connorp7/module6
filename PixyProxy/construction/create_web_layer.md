Lets build the web layer for the following system and service layer. Let's use FastAPI to do this.

The system description is as follows:

'''
The system is a FastAPI-based REST API designed to manage images generated by the OpenAI API. The images are identified by GUIDs for public use and integer IDs for internal use. Each image also has a prompt used to generate it, a filename, and timestamps for creation and updates.

The API provides four endpoints:
1. POST /image: This endpoint generates an image (and image detail) from a prompt.
2. GET /image/{guid}: This endpoint retrieves the details of an image using the provided GUID.
3. GET /image: This endpoint retrieves the details of all images.
4. GET /image/{guid}/content: This endpoint retrieves the image file using the provided GUID.

The system uses a MySQL database to store image details. The database schema includes a table named 'images' with columns for id, guid, filename, prompt, created_at, and updated_at.

The system is structured into four layers:
1. The '/data' layer: This layer uses a repository pattern to interact with the MySQL database. It includes functionality to convert models to dictionaries and vice versa for efficiency. SQL commands use named parameters, and the initialization logic is in an init.py module.
2. The '/service' layer: This layer handles public and private prompt requests in separate modules. It uses pydantic for revalidation of incoming models from the web layer. All exceptions, whether originating from the database or service layer, use a general 'PixyProxyException' format.
3. The '/core' layer: This layer focuses on models and exceptions, all of which extend 'PixyProxyException'.
4. The '/web' layer: This layer manages resources for images. It uses a dependency pattern to ensure required authentication for private resource methods. It also includes a dependency for universal logging of all requests.

The system requires universal request logging in a specific format, with the request-id generated from host-datetime-threadid. All exceptions are handled by a single exception handler. This design ensures a clean separation of concerns, efficient data handling, and robust error management, making the system reliable and maintainable.


'''

Let's make sure to cover the following use cases for our system:

'''
Based on the provided information, here are the use cases for the system:

1. **Use Case: Generate an Image**
    - **Actor**: User
    - **Preconditions**: User has a valid prompt.
    - **Postconditions**: An image and image detail are created and stored in the database.
    - **Normal Flow**: User sends a POST request to /image with a prompt. The system generates an image, creates image details, assigns a GUID, and stores all information in the database.

2. **Use Case: Get Image Details by GUID**
    - **Actor**: User
    - **Preconditions**: Image GUID is valid.
    - **Postconditions**: User receives image details.
    - **Normal Flow**: User sends a GET request to /image/{guid}. The system retrieves the image details associated with the provided GUID and returns them to the user.

3. **Use Case: Get Details for All Images**
    - **Actor**: User
    - **Preconditions**: None.
    - **Postconditions**: User receives details for all images.
    - **Normal Flow**: User sends a GET request to /image. The system retrieves the details for all images and returns them to the user.

4. **Use Case: Retrieve Image File by GUID**
    - **Actor**: User
    - **Preconditions**: Image GUID is valid.
    - **Postconditions**: User receives the image file.
    - **Normal Flow**: User sends a GET request to /image/{guid}/content. The system retrieves the image file associated with the provided GUID and returns it to the user.

5. **Use Case: Perform Operations on Private Images**
    - **Actor**: Authenticated User
    - **Preconditions**: User is authenticated.
    - **Postconditions**: User performs operations on private images.
    - **Normal Flow**: User sends a request to any of the above endpoints with authentication credentials. After successful authentication, the system allows the user to perform the requested operation on private images.

Here is the image service interface and user service interface to use:

'''

        """

        Raises:

            Optional[ImageDetail]: The details of the retrieved image, or None if no image was found.

        Raises:
            RecordNotFoundError: If no image was found with the provided GUID.
            PixyProxyException: If an unexpected error occurs.

Here are the core model objects to use:

'''
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime


class ImageDetailCreate(BaseModel):
    prompt: str


class ImageDetail(ImageDetailCreate):
    guid: str
    filename: str

class Image(ImageDetail):
    id: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
    class_key: str

'''

Here are the core exceptions to use:

'''
class PixyProxyException(Exception):
    pass

class DBConnectionError(PixyProxyException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Error connecting to the database")
        

class RecordNotFoundError(PixyProxyException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(f"Record not found")

class ConstraintViolationError(PixyProxyException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(f"A database constraint was violated")

'''

The web layer is responsible for validation, central exception handling with a single exception handler, and logging of each request (assigning a request id, logging the start and end result of each request per above).

Let's create a FastAPI application with a router for public images and a router for private images. The public router should support read-only access to images before login. The private router should support read-write access to images after login.

Let's use HTTP basic authentication for the private router, and implement a service layer repository and database level repository for user validation. Let's write a global dependency so all endpoints are logged using the required format.

Let's generate a file at a time and pause to think upfront about how things will all fit together.

Then let's generate an API description with enough detail to write test cases for the web layer.
